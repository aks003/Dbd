A PG Project Portal built as a part of the DBMS experential learning.
The technology used is Django template engines. The project consists of three views. The professor view, the student view and the admin view.
The student can submit their deliverables, the professor can award marks to the student and if the professor is a panelist there is also the panelist view. The admin view containes the complete list of marks and charts along with a FAQ chatbot implemented with Google Dialogflow.
